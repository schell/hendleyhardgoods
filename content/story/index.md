This is my grandmaâ€™s cutting board. It now lives in my kitchen. One side is 
pocked from pounding abalone, the other scars of hundreds of meals. A true 
heirloom.

Feeding people has always been an important part of my life. I have been 
happiest when covered in flour, and now sawdust. Years ago a house my great 
grandfather built burned down and I was fortunate enough to salvage some of 
the wood and in an attempt to bring it back to life, I taught myself woodcraft
. The objects I create are intended for use, and for care, for a lifetime. As 
I create I imagine family and friends gathering at your table, around my work, 
connecting over food.

Three concepts inspire my work:
To bring a discarded thing back to life.
To raise awareness of how we consume and waste.
To connect people.
I use salvaged wood or wood from fallen trees thus each piece is one-of-a-kind 
and made by hand. I choose to showcase the natural beauty of the wood 
including knots, blemishes and color variation that you would not find in 
machine-manufactured products.

All of my boards are made in my studio on Hendley Street in Santa Rosa, 
California where food, art, and American folk magic inspire me.

I would love to make something for you from wood salvaged from your family 
home or fallen backyard tree. [Contact me][contact]!
